# Claude Command: Commit

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.

## Usage

To create a commit, just type:
```
/commit
```

Or with options:
```
/commit --no-verify
```

## Language Selection

Before proceeding with the commit process, present the user with language options:

1. **English (#en-US)** - Generate commit messages in English
2. **繁體中文 (#zh-TW)** - Generate commit messages in Traditional Chinese

Wait for the user to select their preferred language before proceeding with any commit operations.

## What This Command Does

1. **Select commit message language** (as described above)
2. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks:
   - Detect package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) and run appropriate commands
   - Run lint/format checks if available
   - Run build verification if build script exists
   - Update documentation if generation script exists
3. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
4. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
5. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed
6. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present
7. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests breaking the commit into multiple smaller commits
8. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format **in the selected language**
9. **Displays the proposed commit message(s) and waits for user confirmation before executing `git commit`**
10. Only proceeds with the commit after receiving explicit approval from the user
11. Do NOT add Claude co-authorship footer to commits

## Best Practices for Commits

- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits
- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ✨ `feat`: New feature
  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix
  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation changes
  - 🎨 `style`: Code style changes
  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring
  - ⚡ `perf`: Performance improvements
  - ✅ `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - 🔧 `chore`: Chores and maintenance

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### English (#en-US)
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "adds feature" or "added feature"
- Keep descriptions concise and clear
- Example: `✨ feat: add user authentication system`

### 繁體中文 (#zh-TW)
- 使用簡潔的動詞開頭：「新增」、「修正」、「更新」等
- 保持描述清楚明確
- 範例：`✨ feat: 新增使用者認證系統`

## User Confirmation Required

Before executing any `git commit` command, Claude will:
1. Present the complete commit message that will be used (in the selected language)
2. Show the list of staged files that will be included
3. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

This ensures you have full control and can review the commit details before they are applied to your repository.
